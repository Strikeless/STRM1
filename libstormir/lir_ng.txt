Probably great ideas for a LIR rewrite:
- Static Single Assignment form variables to simplify codegen and optimization
    - ditch the input and output accumulator concept along with this
    - maybe possibly consider taking an extreme approach and also doing single accesses with a special op for copying
        + variable allocation gets even easier
        + optimizations get easier
        - bit tedious
        - output quality could suffer until there are great folding and deduplication optimizations
