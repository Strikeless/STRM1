The STRM1 first document: ideas to start with and whatnot

Simplistic register-based microprocessor design

ISA planning
    - Instructions
        - NOP, because why not
        - Load value from memory at address of immediate value to specified register
        - Store value from specified register into memory at address of immediate value
        - Copy value from specified register to another
        - Jump in code to address in specified register
        - Arithmetic and bitwise operations working on specified registers

    - Registers in instructions
        - In first word of instruction
        - Two general purpose registers for reading
        ? Either separate third GPR or one of the two read registers for writing

    - Immediate value
        - Second word of instruction

Memory and storage
    - Von Neumann architecture, same memory space for data and code
    - byte-addressable memory for ease of use

Control
    - Microcoded control for research and less pain
